This is a Password Generator, which generates a password using the letter substitution method, from a user-defined Keyword.

From the Keyword defined by the user, the program will check with the user if he typed the desired Keyword, if it is not correct, he can make a single change or correction for the “New Keyword”.

Date of Birth, First Name, Last Name should not be used.

The Keyword can contain uppercase and lowercase letters.

For security, the ideal is that the Password contains 8 to 12 characters.

No special character should be used in the Keyword, as it will already do this replacement.

The program will verify the word and replace the letters of the Key Word with other letters already predefined by the program, namely:

"a" = "@";

"E" = "3";

"e" = "&";

"Ii" = "!";

"Oo" = "0";

"Uu" = "*";

"Ss" = "$";

"Tt" = "?";

"Cc" = "¢";

"Gg" = "¨";

"Bb" = "5";

"m" = "+";

"n" = "^";

"r" = "~";

"Ll" = "11".

Operation:

STEP 1 - Enter the Keyword;

STEP 2 - Select the Option to confirm the Password;

STEP 3 - If the Password is “Correct” - The New Password is Generated.

STEP 4 - If the Keyword is “Wrong” - Enter New Keyword;

STEP 5 - The New Password is generated
